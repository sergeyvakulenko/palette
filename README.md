This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## What is this

Basically, functionally this app is a full copy of @Colt's react-colors application. I had no idea what to implement as a pet project, but I needed to showcase my skills, so here we are.

I've built this app to show my knowledge of React, Redux, RTK, styled components, MUI, basic css stuff like flexbox and so on.

Please, contact me if you need a React developer:
